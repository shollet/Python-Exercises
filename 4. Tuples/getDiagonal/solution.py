# def get_diagonal(input_tuple): - Define a function called "get_diagonal" that takes a tuple of tuples "input_tuple" as an argument.

# return tuple(input_tuple[i][i] for i in range(len(input_tuple))) - Use a generator expression to iterate through the indices i from 0 to the length of the input tuple minus one, and select the diagonal elements by indexing the inner tuples with the same index i. Create a new tuple containing the selected diagonal elements and return it.
