# Line 1: def prepend(self, value):

# This line is defining a new method for the LinkedList class, called prepend. This method takes two arguments: self, which is a reference to the instance of the LinkedList class that this method is being called on; and value, which is the data for the new node that will be inserted at the beginning of the list.

# Line 2: new_node = Node(value)

# This line creates a new instance of the Node class with the given value. The new_node variable is a local variable in the prepend method that holds a reference to the new node.

# Line 3: new_node.next = self.head

# This line sets the next attribute of the new_node to point to the current head of the LinkedList. This is done because new_node is about to become the new head of the list, so it needs to reference the node that will come after it in the list.

# Line 4: self.head = new_node

# This line updates the head attribute of the LinkedList to point to new_node, effectively making new_node the first node in the list. Since new_node already points to the old head of the list (from the previous line), the rest of the list remains intact.

# Line 5: self.length += 1

# This line increments the length attribute of the LinkedList by 1. This is done because we've just added a new node to the list, so the total number of nodes in the list has increased by 1.

# In conclusion, the prepend method allows a new value to be inserted at the start of the LinkedList. It does this by creating a new node with the given value, linking it to the existing head of the list, then updating the head of the list to be the new node, and finally updating the list's length.
