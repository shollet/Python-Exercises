# class Node: This line defines a new class named Node. In the context of linked lists, a node is an individual element of the list which holds the data and a reference to the next node.

# def __init__(self, value): This is the constructor method for the Node class. Whenever a new Node object is created, this method will be called. It takes two parameters: self which is a reference to the current instance of the class, and value which is the data that the node will hold.

# self.value = value: This line sets the value attribute of the node to the value passed to the constructor. This is the data that this node holds.

# self.next = None: This line sets the next attribute of the node to None. In a linked list, the next attribute usually contains a reference to the next node in the list. Here, it's initialized to None because when a node is first created, it doesn't know what the next node is.

# class LinkedList: This line defines a new class named LinkedList. This class represents the linked list itself and will contain nodes.

# def __init__(self, value): This is the constructor method for the LinkedList class. It takes two parameters: self which is a reference to the current instance of the class, and value which is the value for the first node in the linked list.

# new_node = Node(value): This line creates a new Node object with the given value. This new node will be the first node in the linked list.

# self.head = new_node: This line sets the head attribute of the linked list to the new node. In a linked list, the head is a reference to the first node in the list.

# self.tail = self.head: This line sets the tail attribute of the linked list to be the same as the head. This is because, at the moment of creation, the linked list only contains one node, so the head and tail are the same.

# self.length = 1: This line sets the length attribute of the linked list to 1. The length attribute keeps track of how many nodes are in the list. Since we've just created the list with one node, the length is 1.

# The code as a whole defines two classes for a singly linked list data structure. The Node class represents individual nodes in the list, and the LinkedList class represents the list itself. When a LinkedList is created, it also creates an initial Node with a given value.
